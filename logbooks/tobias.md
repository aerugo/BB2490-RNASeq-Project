## Week one

### Captains log, stardate 1502.17 - Startup

Today we planned some meetings for the coming weeks and later, Hugi introduced me and Amy to PyCharm ans GitHub.
We set up a working directory and also tried to push/pull to the working directory on GitHub. I had some minor problems
with setting the rig up since I'm using Windows but with a little bit of work it got sorted out. We (aka Hugi) also 
checked that GitHub is compatible with UppMax, which it seemed to be. As a last thing to mention, I briefed the group I will be busy taking a lab course the next week which will be occupying most of my time unfortunately.

### Captains log, stardate 1502.18 - Project Description

Today I've created a facebook group for communicating with the group. More importantly the project discription and (preliminary) title arrived today so I created a draft of the presentation using the project description and google drive. I also made it clear to the group that they are free to edit it if they wish. PS: Ideally the group would have created the presentation from scratch together, however lack of time before the presentation in combination with poorly matching schedules did not allow this according to me.

### Captains log, stardate 1502.19 - Project Presentation

Today we've presented our projects to the other groups and also listened to the other group presentations about their project. After that rather short session we had a meeting with Olof (our supervisor) and discussed the project description a little more. As a last thing for the group today, we talked a little about what I can do this weekend to make up fo my upcoming lab week. It was decided I should look into studies regarding what softwares to use ans also I should try to find out more about the hypothosis about reaching sequencing saturation.

Supplemental: I did some minor searching on PubMed to try and find out more about the hypothesis of depths saturation but did not find anything relevant. 

### Captains log, stardate 1502.21 - Literature study

I have been searching and reading articles regarding the project, mainly focused on finding comparative studies for software (both for DE analysis and allelic bias). Unfortunately I still have not found any documentation of the saturation hypothesis. This is what reasonable studies I've found so far:
