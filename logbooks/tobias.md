# Diary - Tobias Frick

## Captains log, 1502.17.

Today we planned some meetings for the coming weeks and later, Hugi introduced me and Amy to PyCharm ans GitHub.
We set up a working directory and also tried to push/pull to the working directory on GitHub. I had some minor problems
with setting the rig up since I'm using Windows but with a little bit of work it got sorted out. We (aka Hugi) also 
checked that GitHub is compatible with UppMax, which it seemed to be.
