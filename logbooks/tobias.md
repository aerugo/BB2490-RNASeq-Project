## Captains log, 1502.17. - Startup

Today we planned some meetings for the coming weeks and later, Hugi introduced me and Amy to PyCharm ans GitHub.
We set up a working directory and also tried to push/pull to the working directory on GitHub. I had some minor problems
with setting the rig up since I'm using Windows but with a little bit of work it got sorted out. We (aka Hugi) also 
checked that GitHub is compatible with UppMax, which it seemed to be. As a last thing to mention, I briefed the group I will be busy taking a lab course the next week which will be occupying most of my time unfortunately.

## Captains log, 1502.18. - Project Description

Today I've created a facebook group for communicating with the group. More importantly the project discription and (preliminary) title arrived today so I created a draft of the presentation using the project description and google drive. I also made it clear to the group that they are free to edit it if they wish. PS: Ideally the group would have created the presentation from scratch, however lack of time before the presentation in combination with poorly matching schedules did not allow this.
