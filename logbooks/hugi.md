## Log for BB2490 Project

### February 17th 2016
We settled on GitHub both for hosting code and logbooks. Since the rest of the group were not very familiar with Git, we had a little workshop this afternoon where we set up the GitHub repo. We also decided on Python as our go-to scripting language and set up the IDE PyCharm on Amy's and Tobias's computers. We also made sure that UppMax has Git installed.

Meeting with Olof. We will restrict to 3 individuals.
Need to remove adapters, check quality, discarding stuff...
Random sampling, a fraction of each sample. Sub sampling will be done after processing but before mapping.
Each sample is on 8 different lanes.
Random sampling with same seed on each?
